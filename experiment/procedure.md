 **Select procedure:** This is used to select the part of the experiment to perform.

1. Magnetic field Vs Current. 
2. Hall effect setup.

**Select Material:** 
This slider activates only if Hall Effect setup is selected. And this is used to select the material for finding Hall coefficient and carrier concentration. 

### Button

**Insert Probe/ Remove Probe:** This button used to insert/remove the probe in between the solenoid.

**Show Voltage/ Current:** This will activate only if Hall Effect setup selected and it used to display the Hall voltage/ current in the digital meter.

**Reset:** This button is used to repeat the experiment.
 
### Slider
**Current:** This slider used to vary the current flowing through the Solenoid.

**Hall Current:** This slider used to change the hall current
**Thickness:** This slider used to change the thickness of the material selected.
  
 
### Procedure for doing the simulation:
  To measure the magnetic field generated in the solenoid 
1. Select Magnetic field Vs Current from the procedure combo-box. 
2. Click Insert Probe button 
3. Placing the probe in between the solenoid by clicking the wooden stand in the  
    simulator. 
4.  Using Current slider, varying the current through the solenoid and corresponding  
    magnetic field is to be noted from Gauss meter. 


| Trial NO. | Current Through Solenoid | Magnetic Field Generated |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1         |                          |                          |
| 2         |                          |                          |
| 3         |                          |                          |


### Hall Effect apparatus 

1. Select Hall Effect Setup from the **Select the procedure** combo box 
2. Click Insert **Hall Probe** button  
3. Placing the probe in between the solenoid by clicking the wooden stand in the simulator. 
4. Set "**current slider**" value to minimum. 
5. Select the material from “Select Material” combo-box. 
6. Select the Thickness of the material using the slider **Thickness**. 
7. Vary the Hall current using the slider **Hall current**. 
8. Note down the corresponding Hall voltage by clicking “show voltage” button. 
9. Then calculate Hall coefficient and carrier concentration of that material using the equation.

    Where RH is the Hall coefficient  

    ![eq9](./images/eq9.png)

    And n is the carrier concentration



Repeat the experiment with different magnetic field: 

| Trial NO. | Magnetic Field (Tesla T) | Thickness (t) m | Hall Current (mA) | Hall Voltage, mV | RH |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------|----|
| 1         |                          |                 |                   |                  |    |
| 2         |                          |                 |                   |                  |    |
| 3         |                          |                 |                   |                  |    |
| 4         |                          |                 |                   |                  |    |


### Procedure for doing real lab
1. Connect ‘Constant current source’ to the solenoids.
2. Four probe is connected to the Gauss meter and placed at the middle of the two    
    solenoids.
3. Switch ON the Gauss meter and Constant current source.
4. Vary the current through the solenoid from 1A to 5A with the interval of 0.5A, and  
    note the corresponding Gauss meter readings.
5. Switch OFF the Gauss meter and constant current source and turn the knob of 
    constant current source towards minimum current.
6. Fix the Hall probe on a wooden stand. Connect green wires to Constant Current  
    Generator and connect red wires to milli voltmeter in the Hall Effect apparatus
7. Replace the Four probes with Hall probe and place the sample material at the middle  
    of the two solenoids.
8. Switch ON the constant current source and CCG.
9. Carefully increase the current I from CCG and measure the corresponding Hall 
     voltage VH. Repeat this step for different magnetic field B.
10. Thickness t of the sample is measured using screw gauge.
11. Hence calculate the Hall coefficient RH using the equation 5.
12. Then calculate the carrier concentration n. using equation 6.


### Results

Hall coefficient of the material = _______________

Carrier Concentration of material = ______________ m-3
